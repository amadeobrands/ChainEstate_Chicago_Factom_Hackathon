<Strong>Concept:</Strong>
During the Factom Blockchain Hackatho in Chicago, we made a model to tokenize office space. Instead of expansive and insecure Agents selling office space we have build an smart contracts with embedded KYC and whitelist that will enable a more liquid real estate market. Each project/building will have it's own ERC20 token and then each floor will have its own ERC721 to separate ownership, better control of open space and easy budget management.

On top of all this we integrated an identity chain that will verify all data from the landlords and tenants and will make it reusable on multiple chains in the future. The identity data will be checked on multiple sources and can be verified on multiple places on chain and off chain.
